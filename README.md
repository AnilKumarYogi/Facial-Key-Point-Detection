# Facial-Key-Point-Detection

Using CNN and Keras framework the model detects 15 key points on face such as left_eye_center, right_eye_center, 
left_eye_inner_corner, left_eye_outer_corner, right_eye_inner_corner, right_eye_outer_corner, left_eyebrow_inner_end, 
left_eyebrow_outer_end, right_eyebrow_inner_end, right_eyebrow_outer_end, nose_tip, mouth_left_corner, mouth_right_corner, 
mouth_center_top_lip, mouth_center_bottom_lip

The python notebook explains step-by-step how the model is bulit and trained.
The training dataset is taken from Kaggle downloading link is - https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection
